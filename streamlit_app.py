# About Me
"""
"""
I firmly believe that timing is crucial. During the COVID-19 pandemic, while spending
countless hours at home, I had the chance to reflect on my life. It became clear to me that there
were better job outlooks and missed opportunities waiting for me. Motivated by this realization, I
decided to rekindle my passion for learning. With the rapid advancements in technology, I
became intrigued by how it all worked. This curiosity urged me to enroll in a course on Linux
operating systems. As I immersed myself in the material, my interest in cyber security began to
grow. The idea of acquiring the skills to defend against cyber threats fascinated me and
ultimately led me to pursue a graduate degree in this field.
